TOUB Developer Guidelines

How to obtain the source code:
The main repository of TOUB can be found at: https://github.com/jseery-2076714/TOUB

The layout of your directory structure:
reports (Weekly Reports)
src (Source Code)
modules (Packages)
tests (Test Code)
.github/workflows (Test flows, tells git what tests to run)
.idea (IDE for PyCharm)
README.md (overarching doc woth info on TOUB)
requirements.txt (list of TOUB requirements)
run_tests.sh (script to run tests)
user_manual.txt (User Manual)
developer_guidelines.txt (guidelines for those who are developing TOUB)

How to build the software:
Ensure you have at least Python version 3.10 installed, change your current directory to the TOUB root directory, and run the following command to install
all dependencies:`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

How to test the software:
To build and test the source code for TOUB the first time, ensure you have at least Python version 3.10 installed, change your current directory to the
TOUB root directory, and run the following command to install all dependencies: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
Then run the command `pytest` from the shell to run the unit tests. To run the system tests, first run the main bot using the command `python bot.py`, then
run the command `python src/sys_test.py -c "<Discord channel ID>" -r all "<target bot ID>" "<tester bot token>"`
When pushing to the repo, our CI system (GitHub Actions) runs the python-app.yml script on the GitHub servers, which installs all dependencies and runs the
test scripts automatically.

How to add new tests:
Add tests to either sys_test.py or unit_test.py depending on what you want to test.
Add to sys_test.py for tests that test the discord bot functionality.
Add to unit_test.py for tests that only test our backend. 

How to build a release of the software:
Ensure you have at least Python version 3.10 installed, change your current directory to the TOUB root directory, and run the following command to install
all dependencies:`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
