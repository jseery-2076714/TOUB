# TOUB
Totally Obscure Units Bot<br>
This bot takes any non-SI unit measurement in all Discord chat messages and converts that measurement to obscure units that are unknown to the vast majority of people and likely completely useless. The bot can be integrated into Discord servers like any other bot, and can be adjusted to suit the desired level of chaos.
This repo contains both the bot source code and installation instructions, as well as a copy of the unit conversion database.
