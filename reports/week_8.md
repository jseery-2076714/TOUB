## Team Report

### 1. Action Items from last meeting
 - Frontend: Finish documentation. Clean up all commands.
 - Backend: Perfect functionality of levels 2 and 3.
 - Research: Add more random units.
 - Testing: Write even more tests to cover new functionality, expose bugs in our code, fix those bugs. Maintain git repo and CI functionality.

### 2. Progress and Issues
#### Successes
 - Finished Bot, documentation added to all commands.
 - New Random Units added to Database
 - All features in spec functional in bot
 - Test cases now cover most of functionality

#### Open Issues
 - No clear way to test parsing messages with levels 2&3
 - Some problems when trying to parse messages with floats or extra spaces in formatting

## Contributions of individual team members

### 1. Action Items from last meeting
 - Abby: Add more units. Clean up all commands. Work on minigame with Samuel.
 - Tu: Fix bugs, help where needed
 - Tim: Finish Final Release Assignment
 - Jack: Write more tests to cover newer functionality, continue maintaining git repo and CI functionality.
 - Samuel: Make sure minigame always has the correct conversion for the correct answer

### 2. Progress and Issues
#### Successes
 - Abby: Completed Final Release assignment, focused on reflection
 - Tu: Completed Final Release assignment, focused on demo
 - Tim: Completed Final Release assignment, focused on demo
 - Jack: Wrote lots more tests, majority of deterministic code functionality is covered. Git repo has no major conflicts across branches and CI is still functional. Worked on reflection slides & video.
 - Samuel: Completed Final Release assignment, focused on reflection and made sure the minigame was completed
#### Issues
 - Abby: Communicating and finding time to record the reflection when out of town. Bugs within the commands
 - Tu: bugs with scope of setting levels and multiple valid inputs for parse
 - Tim: found minor bugs with parsing and levels, mainly fixed
 - Jack: Testing for nondeterministic code functionality (levels 2 & 3, minigame) which rely on random selection of units proved to be more difficult than anticipated and the tests do not properly cover those use cases.
 - Samuel: The minigame could be more refined and may still have small bugs
